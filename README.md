# HashSet
A HashSet is a collection of items where every item is unique, and it is found in the java.util package
## Java HashSet Features
1. Implements Set Interface.
2. The underlying data structure for HashSet is Hashtable.
3. As it implements the Set Interface, duplicate values are not allowed.
4. Objects that you insert in HashSet are not guaranteed to be inserted in the same order. Objects are inserted based on their hash code.
5. NULL elements are allowed in HashSet.
6. HashSet also implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
## Declaration of HashSet
